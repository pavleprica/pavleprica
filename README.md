<h3 align="center"> Hello! Nice to meet you! 😄 ✌️ I am Pavle Prica! </h3>
<h4 align="center">One young and passionate software engineer!</h4>
<h6 align="right">On occasion strange 🤭</h6>


🖥️ I am a Software Engineer working at the [Decenter](https://www.decenter.com/), Belgrade. I focus my work on [DefiSaver](https://defisaver.com/). Github [organisation](https://github.com/defisaver).

📖 Web programming is my main development and I feel most comfortable on the backend and infrastructure. Android development, micro-controllers and operating systems are some areas in which I am constantly growing. I am a very dedicated and positive person towards both my work and colleagues.

📥 You can reach me on my [email](mailto:08.bodkins_plat@icloud.com)

👽 In my free time I love to learn more, develop some useful things, communicate, travel,
gaming, and who knows what else. Yeah, a 36-hour day would be short as much as the current 24-hour 🤓.
